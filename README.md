# Craftrice
### A Minecraft Bedrock Edition Calculator through websockets!

Documentation + minecraft world will be published later

Everything in the FlaskCraftrice folder was an attempt to link Flask (websites ran through python) with my websocket system! It is currently not working and you should only use the craftrice.py file up here (with the map that I'll release soon)!
